# üõ†Ô∏è API

This repository contains the API server, primarily for communicating with Firebase. It's a single Node.js file, [`index.mjs`](./index.mjs) that runs a [Polka](https://github.com/lukeed/polka) server which sends data to Firebase.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The following environment variables are required:

- `FIREBASE_DATABASE_URL` is the full Firebase database URL
- `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` is the service account key in JSON

Locally, these environment variables are loaded from a `.env`. This repository also uses GitHub Actions CI/CD and triggers an endpoint for deployment from the `master` branch. Optionally, you may add the required environment variables as repository secrets (see [Creating and storing encrypted secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/creating-and-storing-encrypted-secrets)).
